# Pomegranate (frontend)
Welcome! This repo contains the frontend for an application that I work on (as time allows). It connects various of my utility 
accounts into one dashboard and allows you to refresh to see your balance. This is only the first iteration of the project.

Written in ReactJS

## Goals
1) Allow for all utility accounts be monitored in one spot
2) Allow for future functionality that comes with managing any accounts (pay bills, change address, etc)
